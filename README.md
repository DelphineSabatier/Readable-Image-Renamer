# Readable Image Renamer
I deleted some photos from my camera's memory card and attempted to recover them using two different software programs. As a result, I ended up with numerous duplicate images, each with a different file name format, and some of them are not readable.

### Objective
Rename all readable pictures with a uniform name format. This will allow me to quickly identify duplicates and decide how to manage them.

### How It Works
Use the provided scripts to:

1 Test each image to determine readability. \
2 Ensure coverage of all naming formats by renaming only the list of filenames (not the actual files). \
3 Once you are confident in covering all naming formats, proceed to directly rename all the files. \
